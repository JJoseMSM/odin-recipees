        <p>Pizza "Tlayuda" is a crispy, thin-crust Mexican pizza that is inspired by one of Oaxaca’s most famous street foods. The base is a tortilla, the sauce is made with refried beans, and it is topped with cheese and veggies.</p>

        <h1>How to Make Tlayuda</h1>
        <p> The detailed suya recipe is below, but here are some chef’s notes: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>As I mention in the video, a real tlayuda is done with a very large, thin corn tortilla, which is cooked crisp, before being topped with refried beans, shredded Oaxacan cheese, along with all sorts of meat, and vegetable garnishes. It is a magical thing indeed, but I wanted to make a baked version that would shine using the much easier to find flour tortillas. I really love how this comes out.</li>

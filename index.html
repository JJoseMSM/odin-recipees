        <h1>How to Make Tlayuda</h1>
        <p> The detailed suya recipe is below, but here are some chef’s notes: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>As I mention in the video, a real tlayuda is done with a very large, thin corn tortilla, which is cooked crisp, before being topped with refried beans, shredded Oaxacan cheese, along with all sorts of meat, and vegetable garnishes. It is a magical thing indeed, but I wanted to make a baked version that would shine using the much easier to find flour tortillas. I really love how this comes out.</li>

            <li>6 large flour tortillas</li>

            <li>12 whole Brussels sprouts, cored and separated into leaves</li>

        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <h2>Refried Black Beans:</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Combine avocado oil, green onions, minced garlic, and a pinch of salt in a saucepan and place over medium heat. Once garlic starts to sizzle, cook and stir for 1 minute. Add cumin, black pepper, and ancho chili powder, and cook stirring for 30 seconds.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Add water, drained black beans, remaining salt, oregano, cayenne, and asiento (crispy pork butter, see Cook's Note). Stir together and simmer for 5 minutes. Use a potato masher to mash beans until smooth. Simmer for 5 minutes more. Turn off heat and taste to adjust seasoning if necessary.</p>

        <h2>Pizza "Tlayuda"</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Heat some of the avocado oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add 1 large flour tortilla at a time and cook until golden brown and almost crispy, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining tortillas.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Spread toasted tortilla with refried black beans and sprinkle with cheese. Top with Brussels sprouts leaves and green onions. Drizzle top lightly with olive oil, and season with a pinch of salt.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Bake in the preheated oven until pizza is crispy and well browned,  cheese is melted, and Brussels sprouts leaves are nicely charred on the edges, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack, and let sit for 5 minutes.</p>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">While resting, top with radishes, hot sauce or salsa, and cilantro leaves.</p>
